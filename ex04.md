# How to run the code
The measurements are run by the run_montecarlo_job.sh script which can be started like `sbatch --array=0-188 --nice=200 -J "Happy NY" run_montecarlo_job.sh`.
This script launches the simulations with a specific standard deviation (for the mc tests) or creates parameter files with different Reynold numbers (for the trapezoidal rule).
The simulation then outputs the time step, the simulated time and the measured data to stdout.
This output is then fed to the `sed` tool to extract the data, which is then stored in `<measurement number>.dat` files  which can be directly loaded by gnuplot or numpy.
The final analysis is then done by the `analyze_montecarlo.py` script which outputs the plots to `plots4`.

Both, the mean and sigma, show the expected theoretical convergence of $O(\sqrt(n)^{-1})$.

# Trapezoidal Rule

Difference between Monte Carlo (red) and Trapezoidal Rule (blue)

![](plots4/monte_carlo_vs_trapezoidal_over_time_for_8.png)
Convergence of all measurements (u,v,vel for all three points) for trapezoidal rule (red), first extrapolation (blue), second extrapolation (green), and third extrapolation (yellow) for different grid resolutions.
Using a hierarchical trapezoidal rule one can easily update one quadrature by adding more points using the formula $L * \sum_{i:new} f_i*p_i / 2^{level} + T_{level-1} / 2$.

The trapezoidal rule shown the expected $O(h^2)$ convergence.
The simpson rule shows the expected $O(h^4)$ convergence.
Even one further extrapolation shows an expected $O(h^6)$ convergence for the first refinements but quickly levels out at $2^-28$. One further extrapolation doesen't show any further improvement. This might be due to the fact, that extrapolating the results assume a specific error model for the function to be integrated, which imply in smoothness requirements on the integrand which might not be satisfied for our resulting velocities.

`<file name>_for_X.png` means that this plot is for value X, where:

 * X = 2 means u at point 0
 * X = 3 means v at point 0
 * X = 4 means u at point 1
 * X = 5 means v at point 1
 * X = 6 means u at point 2
 * X = 7 means v at point 2
 * X = 8 means velocity at point 0
 * X = 9 means velocity at point 1
 * X = 10 means velocity at point 2

# When should we use MC or quadrature?

 * Quadrature $O(h^p) = O(\sqrt[d]{N}^p) = O(N^{p/d})$
 * MC         $O(sqrt(N)) = O(N^{1/2})$

We should use Monte Carlo if $p/d \le 1/2$ which is equivalent to $2p \le d$. This means that the quadrature rule should have at least an order of half the dimensionality of the problem. Thus, the Monte Carlo method becomes superior for high dimensional problems.

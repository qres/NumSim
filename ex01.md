Smaller re => creates vortex more quickly, small circle => Honey, more friction
Larger  re => slowly emerging vortex, large circle => Water, no friction

# Measure Space Discretization
Take known functions and compute the spacial derivatives in grid points analytically. Then evaluate the functions on grid points on grids with different mesh size, and compare the discrete derivatives with the analytic derivative. Then measure the convergence for decreasing mesh sizes.

### Theoretical
O(N^2) or O(N) : Number of time steps increase for Diffusion or Convection
O(N^2): Euler etc. 
O(N^3): SOR

```
=> O(N * (N^2 + N^3))
     ^    ^~^   ^~^
     |     |     |
     |     |     +- SOR (with good preinitialization)
     |     +- Euler + Derivatives
     +- convection bound (see first question)

However we cut at Iter=100 => SOR for large N is only O(N^2)
=> O(N^3)
```

SOR iteration increase for smaller grid size due to small eigenvectors of the error propagation matrix.

Also we always have omega = 1.7 which is not the optimal choice for all grids as omega_opt = 2 / (1 + sin(pi h)).
This explains why we get 2^4.78 instead of 2^4 which would be for small grids (< 512 i.e. convection bound) `N * (N^2 + N^3)`.

## td limit

re: 1000
```
for grids `< 2^k = 512` we are convection bound
for larger `>= 2^k = 512` we are diffusion bound

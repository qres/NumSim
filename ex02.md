# communication time
The communication time does not increase much for larger grids, as all communication can be done in parallel.

The following plot shows the average communication per process and the min/max over all processes for different number of processes on a 4096x4096 grid.

However the total time per solver step decreases.

Computation: N^2 / P
The communication time should be like O(N / sqrt P) as the local 'surface' is 4*N/sqrt(p). In total we have to communicate more data, but the local data transfer is reduced for more processes. However every datatransfer also has a high fixed cost part which means that we can not reducre the runtime for ever: see theoretical speedup

# computational time for the global residual reduction
The time needed for a Reduction should behave like log(p). However the minimum and maximum vary a lot for each process.

Computing: timestep N^2
Reduciton: log(p)
-> N^2 or log(p) depending on gridsize

# speedup

Runtime shows almost perfect scaling as we have a large grid and lots of computations:

As the poisson has a large proportion of parallel code, and the grid is large enough, we can achive a good speedup.

The theoretical speedup is 1/(1-f + f/p). E.g for f=0.75 the theoretical speedup looks like

# parallel efficiency
The parallell is largest for a small number of processes. For large number of processes the sequencial protion of the code will start to dominate and the efficiency will decay.
